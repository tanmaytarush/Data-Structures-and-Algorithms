Pattern Problems rules :-

1. Will have two nested loops
2. Outer loops are for the rows
3. Inner loops are for the columns
4. For the outer loop count the number of lines/rows
5. For the inner loop, focus on columns and connect them to rows
6. Print stuff inside inner loop
7. Observe symmetry in some cases
