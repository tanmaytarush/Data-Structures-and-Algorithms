QUESTION:
Given an array arr[] of size N, check if it is sorted in non-decreasing order or not.

APPROACH:
- We can use a recursive approach to check if the array is sorted in non-decreasing order or not.
- The base case for recursion is when the subarray has only one element or when the subarray is empty, in which case we consider it to be sorted.
- For a non-empty subarray, we compare the middle element with its next element. If they are in non-decreasing order and both the left and right subarrays are also sorted, then we consider the entire array to be sorted.
- We recursively check the left and right subarrays using the same approach.
- If any of the recursive calls returns false, we return false. Otherwise, we return true.

Example:

Input:
N = 5
arr[] = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}
Output: 1
Explanation: The given array is sorted.

CODE:
*/



// TIME COMPLEXITY: O(log N)
// SPACE COMPLEXITY: O(log N) (for recursion stack)
