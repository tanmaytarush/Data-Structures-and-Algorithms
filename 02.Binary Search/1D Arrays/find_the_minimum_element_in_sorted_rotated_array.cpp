QUESTION:
Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1 and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might become:

[4,5,6,7,0,1,2] if it was rotated 4 times.
[0,1,2,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.

Given the sorted rotated array nums of unique elements, return the minimum element of this array.

APPROACH:
We can use the binary search approach to find the minimum element.
1. Initialize low = 0 and high = n-1, where n is the size of the array.
2. While low < high, calculate mid = low + (high - low) / 2.
3. If nums[mid] > nums[high], it means the minimum element is on the right side of mid, so update low = mid+1.
4. Otherwise, the minimum element is on the left side of mid or mid itself, so update high = mid.
5. After the loop ends, low will be pointing to the minimum element index.
6. Return nums[low] as the result.

int minSorted(vector<int> &arr)
{
    int n = arr.size();
    int low = 0;
    int high = n-1;
    int ans = INT_MAX;

    while(low <= high)
    {
        int mid = (low + (high - low)/2);

        // edge condition (already on sorted portion)
        if(arr[low] <= arr[high])
        {
            ans = min(ans, arr[low]);
            break;
        }

        // left sorted
        if(arr[low] <= arr[mid])
        {
            ans = min(ans, arr[low]);
            low = mid + 1;
        }

        // right sorted
        else
        {
            ans = min(ans, arr[mid]);
            high = mid - 1;
        }
    }
    return ans;

    int result = minSorted(arr);

    cout<<result;
