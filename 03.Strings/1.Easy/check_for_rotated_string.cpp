/*
QUESTION: Rotate String
Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.

A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.

Example:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true

Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false

Approach:
- First, we check if the lengths of the two strings `s` and `goal` are equal. If not, they cannot be rotated versions of each other, so we return `false`.
- Then, we concatenate `s` with itself to create a new string `concat`.
- We check if `goal` is a substring of `concat`. If it is, that means `s` can be transformed into `goal` by performing some number of left shifts, so we return `true`. Otherwise, we return `false`.

CODE:-
*/

#include<iostream>
#include<vector>
#include<algorithm>
#include<math.h>
using namespace std;

bool rotatedString(string s, string goal)
{
    if(s.length() != goal.length())
    {
        return false;
    }

    string doubleStr = s + s;

    return doubleStr.find(goal) < doubleStr.length();
}

int main()
{
    string s;
    string goal;
    getline(cin, s);
    getline(cin, goal);

    bool result = rotatedString(s, goal);

    cout<<result;
    return 0;
}

/*
Time Complexity: The time complexity of this approach is O(N^2), where N is the length of the input strings `s` and `goal`. This is because the `find` function is used to search for the substring `goal` within the concatenated string, which has a time complexity of O(N^2).
Space Complexity: The space complexity is O(N), where N is the length of the input string `s`. This is because we create a new string `concat` by concatenating `s` with itself.
